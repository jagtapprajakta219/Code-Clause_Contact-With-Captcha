# Contact-US
Contact Us is a simple web application that allows users to get in touch with an organization by filling out a form with their name, email, subject, and message.

The user can enter their name in the designated field, along with their email address. The email address is necessary for the organization to respond to the user's inquiry. The user can then enter the subject of their message, which should be a brief summary of the topic they want to discuss. Lastly, the user can type out their message, providing details or asking questions as needed.

Once the user has filled out the form, they can submit it by clicking on the "Submit" button. The organization will receive the message and respond as soon as possible.

Overall, Contact Us is a simple yet effective way for users to communicate with organizations and get the information they need. It streamlines the process of sending a message, eliminates the need for traditional methods such as email or phone calls, and provides a straightforward way for users to get their questions answered.
